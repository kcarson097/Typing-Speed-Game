Typing Speed Game using tkinter GUI

Using the beautiful soup library, this program will connect to "http://www.englishinuse.net/ and obtain a random sentence for the user to enter.
The user will be prompted to type in the text as quickly as then can.
A timer is started when the user clicks on the entry box and is stopped when they click enter/return.
The program will then return the total time taken,the wpm, characters per second and the accuracy of the statement.
A new phrase can be generated using the new phrase button which will also reset the timer to zero.
